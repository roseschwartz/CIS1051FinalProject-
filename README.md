We had difficulties coding the AI to not always win. We wanted to make sure that this game could be won against the AI, with the help of the powerups. The AI tracks the y-coordinate of the ball and tries to match it. We were able to make the AI beatable on occasion by decreasing the original speed of the AI's paddle. That way, it always attempts to hit the ball but doesn't always. 

We worked on the editing the distribution code together in Visual Studio Code, so only the final changes are shown in GitHub.
